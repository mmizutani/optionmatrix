Run: ./configure
Then run: make
cd src

There will be two executables built optionmatrix and 
optionmatrix_console. optionmatrix is the GTK+ executable
(graphical version) optionmatrix_console is the curses
executable (text version)
Run either one by typing ./optionmatrix or
./optionmatrix_console

To install under Linux / Unix run: sudo make install

The curses, ncurses or pdcurses library is needed to compile
optionmatrix_console. The gtk-3 or gtk-x11-2.0 library is need to
compile optionmatrix

The configure script also checks for the installation of the
GSL, Newmat and IT++ libraries. These libraries are not
needed but inclusion will cause the application will have
a few more models.
