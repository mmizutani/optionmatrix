* Merge with GTK+ stochastic graphing engine -> GAME
  Graphing gold, blue, silver, yellow and interest rate.

  approach as date advances 1 day every 2 seconds. Give user ability
  to left click buy/sell spots, buy/sell puts, buy/sell calls, 
  buy/sell futures on stochastics. Have spreads between stochastics.
  One stochastic process is interest rate. Right click properties on stochastic
  adjust standard deviation, make mean bearing, random walking, maybe have
  computer algebraic interpreter (e.g. sin wave). Have fake brokerage account
  update with positions and values.
